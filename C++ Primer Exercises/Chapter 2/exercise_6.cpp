 * @brief Exercise 6 from C++ Primer Chapter 2
 * Write a program that has main() call a user-defined function that takes a
 * distance in light years as an argument and then returns the distance in
 * astronomical units.
 * The program should request the light year value as input from the user and
 * display the result, as shown in the following code:
 * Enter the number of light years: 4.2
 * 4.2 light years = 265608 astronomical units.
 * @version 0.1
