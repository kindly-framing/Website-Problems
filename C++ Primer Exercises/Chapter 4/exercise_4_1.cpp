/**
 * @file exercise_4_1.cpp
 * @author Steven Aquino
 * @brief Write a C++ program that requests and displays information as shown in
 * the following example of output:
 * What is your first name? Betty Sue
 * What is your last name? Yewe
 * What letter grade do you deserve? B
 * What is your age? 22
 * Name: Yewe, Betty Sue
 * Grade: C
 * Age: 22
 *
 * Note that the program should be able to accept first names that comprise more
 * than one word.Also note that the program adjusts the grade downward—that is,
 * up one letter.Assume that the user requests an A,a B, or a C so that you
 * don’t have to worry about the gap between a D and an F
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2022-05-22
