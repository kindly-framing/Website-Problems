 * @brief William Wingate runs a pizza-analysis service. For each pizza, he
 * needs to record the following information:
 * The name of the pizza company, which can consist of more than one word
 * The diameter of the pizza
 * The weight of the pizza
 * Devise a structure that can hold this information and
 * write a program that uses a structure variable of that type.The program
 * should ask the user to enter each of the preceding items of information,and
 * then the program should display that information. Use cin (or its methods)
 * and cout.
