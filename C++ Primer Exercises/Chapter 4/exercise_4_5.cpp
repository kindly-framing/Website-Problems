 * @brief The CandyBar structure contains three members.The first member holds
 * the brand name of a candy bar.The second member holds the weight (which may
 * have a fractional part) of the candy bar,and the third member holds the
 * number of calories (an integer value) in the candy bar.Write a program that
 * declares such a structure and creates a CandyBar variable called snack,
 * initializing its members to "Mocha Munch", 2.3,and 350, respectively.The
 * initialization should be part of the declaration for snack. Finally, the
 * program should display the contents of the snack variable.
