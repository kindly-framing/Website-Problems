 * Review Question 5 and write a short program that illustrates all the
 * features.
 *
 * Define a class to represent a bank account. Data members should include the
 * depositor’s name, the account number (use a string),and the balance. Member
 * functions should allow the following:
 *
 * Creating an object and initializing it.
 * Displaying the depositor’s name,account number,and balance
 * Depositing an amount of money given by an argument
 * Withdrawing an amount of money given by an argument
 *
 * Just show the class declaration, not the method implementations. (Programming
 * Exercise 1 provides you with an opportunity to write the implementation.)
