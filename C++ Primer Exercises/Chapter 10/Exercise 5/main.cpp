/**
 * @file exercise_10_5.cpp
 * @author Steven Aquino
 * @brief Consider the following structure declaration:
 *
 * struct customer {
 * char fullname[35];
 * double payment;
 * };
 *
 * Write a program that adds and removes customer structures from a stack,
 * represented by a Stack class declaration. Each time a customer is removed,
 * his or her payment should be added to a running total,and the running total
 * should be reported. Note: You should be able to use the Stack class
 * unaltered; just change the typedef declaration so that Item is type customer
 * instead of unsigned long.
