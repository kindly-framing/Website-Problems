 * @brief The CandyBar structure contains three members.The first member holds
 * the brand name of a candy bar.The second member holds the weight (which may
 * have a fractional part) of the candy bar,and the third member holds the
 * number of calories (an integer value) in the candy bar.Write a program that
 * uses a function that takes as arguments a reference to CandyBar,a
 * pointer-to-char, a double,and an int and uses the last three values to set
 * the corresponding members of the structure.The last three arguments should
 * have default values of “Millennium Munch,” 2.85,and 350. Also the program
 * should use a function that takes a reference to a CandyBar as an argument and
 * displays the contents of the structure. Use const where appropriate.
