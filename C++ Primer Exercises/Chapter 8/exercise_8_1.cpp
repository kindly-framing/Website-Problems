 * @brief Write a function that normally takes one argument, the address of a
 * string,and prints that string once. However, if a second, type int,argument
 * is provided and is nonzero, the function should print the string a number of
 * times equal to the number of times that function has been called at that
 * point. (Note that the number of times the string is printed is not equal
 * to the value of the second argument; it is equal to the number of times the
 * function has been called.) Yes, this is a silly function, but it makes you
 * use some of the techniques discussed in this chapter. Use the function in a
 * simple program that demonstrates how the function works.
