 * @brief Write a short program that asks for your height in feet and inches and
 * your weight in pounds. (Use three variables to store the information.) Have
 * the program report your body mass index (BMI).To calculate the BMI, first
 * convert your height in feet and inches to your height in inches (1 foot = 12
 * inches).Then convert your height in inches to your height in meters by
 * multiplying by 0.0254. Then convert your weight in pounds into your mass in
 * kilograms by dividing by 2.2. Finally, compute your BMI by dividing your mass
 * in kilograms by the square of your height in meters. Use symbolic constants
 * to represent the various conversion factors.
