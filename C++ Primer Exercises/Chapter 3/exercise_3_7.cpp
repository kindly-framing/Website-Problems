 * @brief Write a program that asks you to enter an automobile gasoline
 * consumption figure in the European style (liters per 100 kilometers) and
 * converts to the U.S. style of miles per gallon. Note that in addition to
 * using different units of measurement, the U.S.approach (distance / fuel) is
 * the inverse of the European approach (fuel / distance). Note that 100
 * kilometers is 62.14 miles,and 1 gallon is 3.875 liters.Thus, 19 mpg is
 * about 12.4 l/100 km,and 27 mpg is about 8.7 l/100 km.
 * @version 0.1
