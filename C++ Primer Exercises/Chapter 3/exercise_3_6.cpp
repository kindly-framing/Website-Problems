 * @brief Write a program that asks how many miles you have driven and how many
 * gallons of gasoline you have used and then reports the miles per gallon your
 * car has gotten. Or, if you prefer, the program can request distance in
 * kilometers and petrol in liters and then report the result European style, in
 * liters per 100 kilometers.
