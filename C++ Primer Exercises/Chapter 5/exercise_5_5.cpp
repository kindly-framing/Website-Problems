 * @brief You sell the book C++ for Fools. Write a program that has you enter a
 * year’s worth of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money).
 * The program should use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of
 * char* (or an array of string objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month
 * strings and storing the input data in an array of int. Then, the program
 * should find the sum of the array contents and report the total sales for the
 * year.
