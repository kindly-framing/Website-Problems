 * @brief Write a program using nested loops that asks the user to enter a
 * value for the number of rows to display. It should then display that many
 * rows of asterisks, with one asterisk in the first row, two in the second
 * row,and so on. For each row, the asterisks are preceded by the number of
 * periods needed to make all the rows display a total number of characters
 * equal to the number of rows.A sample run would look like this:
 * Enter number of rows: 5
