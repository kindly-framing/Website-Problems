 * @brief Write a program that requests the user to enter two integers. The
 * program should then calculate and report the sum of all the integers between
 * and including the two integers. At this point,assume that the smaller integer
 * is entered first. For example, if the user enters 2 and 9, the program
 * should report that the sum of all the integers from 2 through 9 is 44.
