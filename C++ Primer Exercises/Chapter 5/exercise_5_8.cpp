 * @brief Write a program that uses an array of char and a loop to read one word
 * at a time until the word done is entered. The program should then report the
 * number of words entered (not counting done). A sample run could look like
 * this:
 *
 * Enter words (to stop, type the word done):
 * anteater birthday category dumpster envy finagle geometry done for sure
 * You entered a total of 7 words.
 *
 * You should include the cstring header file and use the strcmp() function to
 * make the comparison test.
 * @version 0.1
