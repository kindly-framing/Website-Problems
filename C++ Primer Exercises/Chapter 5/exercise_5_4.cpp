 * @brief Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest. That is, every year, the
 * investment earns 10% of the original investment, or $10 each and every year:
 *
 * interest = 0.10 × original balance
 *
 * At the same time, Cleo invests $100 at 5% compound interest. That is,
 * interest is 5% of the current balance, including previous additions of
 * interest:
 *
 * interest = 0.05 × current balance
 *
 * Cleo earns 5% of $100 the first year, giving her $105. The next year she
 * earns 5% of $105, or $5.25, and so on.
 * Write a program that finds how many years it takes for the value of Cleo’s
 * investment to exceed the value of Daphne’s investment and then displays the
 * value of both investments at that time.
