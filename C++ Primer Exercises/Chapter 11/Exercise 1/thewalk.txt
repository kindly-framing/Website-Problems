Target Distance: 100, Step size: 50
0: (x,y) = (0, 0)
1: (x,y) = (37.1572, -33.4565)
2: (x,y) = (25.9097, -82.175)
3: (x,y) = (40.5283, -129.99)
After 3 steps, the subject has the following location:
(x,y) = (40.5283, -129.99)
 or
(m,a) = (136.162, -72.6836)
Average outward distance per step = 45.3872
