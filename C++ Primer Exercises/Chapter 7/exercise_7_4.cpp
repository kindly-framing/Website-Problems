 * @brief Many state lotteries use a variation of the simple lottery portrayed
 * by Listing 7.4. In these variations you choose several numbers from one set
 * and call them the field numbers. For example, you might select five numbers
 * from the field of 1–47).You also pick a single number (called a mega number
 * or a power ball, etc.) from a second range, such as 1–27.To win the grand
 * prize, you have to guess all the picks correctly.The chance of winning is the
 * product of the probability of picking all the field numbers times the
 * probability of picking the mega number. For instance, the probability of
 * winning the example described here is the product of the probability of
 * picking 5 out of 47 correctly times the probability of picking 1 out of 27
 * correctly. Modify Listing 7.4 to calculate the probability of winning this
 * kind of lottery.
