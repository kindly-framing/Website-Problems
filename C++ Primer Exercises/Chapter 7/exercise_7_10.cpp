 * @author Steven Aquino
 * @brief Design a function calculate() that takes two type double values and a
 * pointer to a function that takes two double arguments and returns a
 * double.The calculate() function should also be type double,and it should
 * return the value that the pointed-to function calculates, using the double
 * arguments to calculate(). For example, suppose you have this definition for
 * the add() function:
 *
 * double add(double x, double y)
 * {
 * return x + y;
 * }
 *
 * Then, the function call in the following would cause calculate() to pass the
 * values 2.5 and 10.4 to the add() function and then return the add() return
 * value (12.9):
 * double q = calculate(2.5, 10.4, add);
 *
 * Use these functions and at least one additional function in the add() mold in
 * a program.The program should use a loop that allows the user to enter pairs
 * of numbers. For each pair, use calculate() to invoke add() and at least one
 * other function. If you are feeling adventurous, try creating an array of
 * pointers to add()-style functions and use a loop to successively apply
 * calculate() to a series of functions by using these pointers. Hint: Hereâ€™s
 * how to declare such an array of three pointers:
 * double (*pf[3])(double, double);
 *
 * You can initialize such an array by using the usual array initialization
 * syntax and function names as addresses.
