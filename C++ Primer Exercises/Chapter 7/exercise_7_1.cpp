 * @brief Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to enter pairs of
 * numbers until at least one of the pair is 0. For each pair, the program
 * should use a function to calculate the harmonic mean of the numbers.The
 * function should return the answer to main(), which should report the
 * result.The harmonic mean of the numbers is the inverse of the average of the
 * inverses and can be calculated as follows:
 * harmonic mean = 2.0 × x × y / (x + y)
 * @version 0.1
