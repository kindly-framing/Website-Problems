 * @brief Write a program that reads input a word at a time until a lone q is
 * entered.The program should then report the number of words that began with
 * vowels, the number that began with consonants,and the number that fit neither
 * of those categories. One approach is to use isalpha() to discriminate between
 * words beginning with letters and those that don’t and then use an if or
 * switch statement to further identify those passing the isalpha() test that
 * begin with vowels.A sample run might look like this:
 * Enter words (q to quit):
 * The 12 awesome oxen ambled
 * quietly across 15 meters of lawn. q
 * 5 words beginning with vowels
 * 4 words beginning with consonants
 * 2 others
 * @version 0.1
