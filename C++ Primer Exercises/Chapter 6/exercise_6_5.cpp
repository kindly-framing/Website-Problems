 * @brief The Kingdom of Neutronia, where the unit of currency is the tvarp, has
 * the following income tax code:
 * First 5,000 tvarps: 0% tax
 * Next 10,000 tvarps: 10% tax
 * Next 20,000 tvarps: 15% tax
 * Tvarps after 35,000: 20% tax
 * For example, someone earning 38,000 tvarps would owe 5,000 × 0.00 + 10,000 ×
 * 0.10 + 20,000 × 0.15 + 3,000 × 0.20, or 4,600 tvarps.Write a program that
 * uses a loop to solicit incomes and to report tax owed.The loop should
 * terminate when the user enters a negative number or non-numeric input.
 * @version 0.1
 * @date 2022-06-12
